# Gosub MacOS Client
This is a proof of concept and NOT a functional client.

Think of this as a sandbox as we develop the [Gosub Engine](https://github.com/gosub-browser/gosub-engine) and figure things out.

# Preview (as of 18 Nov 2023)

# Architecture
TODO

# What to do?
We are trying to implement various features according to our wish list: https://github.com/gosub-browser/gosub-engine/wiki/Browser-features

If this client becomes mature enough and meets our needs, we can possibly transfer this repo to the official Gosub org.
